## **📖 Usage**

### **Basic Usage**

1. Add the **"QwenVL"** node from the 🧪AILab/QwenVL category.  
2. Select the **model\_name** you wish to use.  
3. Connect an image or video (image sequence) source to the node.  
4. Write your prompt using the preset or custom field.  
5. Run the workflow.

### **Advanced Usage**

For more control, use the **"QwenVL (Advanced)"** node. This gives you access to detailed generation parameters like temperature, top\_p, beam search, and device selection.

## **⚙️ Parameters**

| Parameter | Description | Default | Range | Node(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **model\_name** | The Qwen-VL model to use. | Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct | \- | Standard & Advanced |
| **quantization** | On-the-fly quantization. Ignored for pre-quantized models (e.g., FP8). | 8-bit (Balanced) | 4-bit, 8-bit, None | Standard & Advanced |
| **preset\_prompt** | A selection of pre-defined prompts for common tasks. | "Describe this..." | Any text | Standard & Advanced |
| **custom\_prompt** | Overrides the preset prompt if provided. |  | Any text | Standard & Advanced |
| **max\_tokens** | Maximum number of new tokens to generate. | 1024 | 64-2048 | Standard & Advanced |
| **keep\_model\_loaded** | Keep the model in VRAM for faster subsequent runs. | True | True/False | Standard & Advanced |
| **seed** | A seed for reproducible results. | 1 | 1 \- 2^64-1 | Standard & Advanced |
| **temperature** | Controls randomness. Higher values \= more creative. (Used when num\_beams is 1). | 0.6 | 0.1-1.0 | Advanced Only |
| **top\_p** | Nucleus sampling threshold. (Used when num\_beams is 1). | 0.9 | 0.0-1.0 | Advanced Only |
| **num\_beams** | Number of beams for beam search. \> 1 disables temperature/top\_p sampling. | 1 | 1-10 | Advanced Only |
| **repetition\_penalty** | Discourages repeating tokens. | 1.2 | 0.0-2.0 | Advanced Only |

### **💡 Quantization Options**

| Mode | Precision | Memory Usage | Speed | Quality | Recommended For |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| None (FP16) | 16-bit Float | High | Fastest | Best | High VRAM GPUs (16GB+) |
| 8-bit (Balanced) | 8-bit Integer | Medium | Fast | Very Good | Balanced performance (8GB+) |
| 4-bit (VRAM-friendly) | 4-bit Integer | Low | Slower\* | Good | Low VRAM GPUs (\<8GB) |

\* **Note on 4-bit Speed**: 4-bit quantization significantly reduces VRAM usage but may result in slower performance on some systems due to the computational overhead of real-time dequantization.

### **🤔 Setting Tips**

| Setting | Recommendation |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Model Choice** | For most users, Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct is a great starting point. If you have a 40-series GPU, try the \-FP8 version for better performance. |
| **Memory Mode** | Keep keep\_model\_loaded enabled (True) for the best performance if you plan to run the node multiple times. Disable it only if you are running out of VRAM for other nodes. |
| **Quantization** | Start with the default 8-bit. If you have plenty of VRAM (\>16GB), switch to None (FP16) for the best speed and quality. If you are low on VRAM, use 4-bit. |
| **Performance** | The first time a model is loaded with a specific quantization, it may be slow. Subsequent runs (with keep\_model\_loaded enabled) will be much faster. |
